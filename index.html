    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Abstract.</strong>
        News has a profound influence on public opinion, shaping both short-term discourse and long-term social attitudes. 
        Social media has amplified this influence and has made public journalism more accessible than ever, creating a news overload. 
        Moreover, the rise of social media as a news source has raised concerns about polarization and echo chambers.

        In this dissertation, we present computational frameworks to analyze news and social media discourse based on news. 

        First, we analyze political slant in election-related news and discourse on social media based on sentiment toward political figures. 
        We observe that both traditional online news and social media exhibit political slant, with significant differences across publishers with different presumed political leanings. 
        However, content on social media is more sentiment-driven, with a stronger political slant than traditional news. 
        User responses on social media reveal a moral divide between readers of different news sources, suggesting that audiences focus on different aspects of the same news depending on which news source they follow.

        Second, we identify the moral framing in the news related to the ongoing Gaza conflict and analyze it using the war and peace journalism framework. 
        We employ a vector subspace projection approach to identify moral framing and leverage language models fine-tuned on a crowdsourced annotated dataset for war and peace journalism analysis. 
        We observe significant variations in how different publishers frame the same events, with distinct moral perspectives aligning with their presumed political leanings, suggesting partisan coverage. 
        A concerning trend we observe is the causal association between news publishers, suggestive of agenda-setting, where one publisher’s framing influences another's.

        Third, we create a simulation testbed to explore the effects of selective exposure to congenial (like-minded) content on polarization dynamics in a social network. 
        We observe that while selective exposure to congenial content enhances user satisfaction by tailoring content to individual preferences, it contributes to ideological divides, intensifying polarization within the network.
        Moreover, it limits the reach of content across diverse audiences.
        In contrast, increased user tolerance mitigates polarization; however, this comes at the expense of user satisfaction.

        Our analysis reveals slants in political news and a moral divide on social media among audiences of different news sources, as well as how news coverage by one publisher influences another.
